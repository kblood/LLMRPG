## What You'll Experience

Every moment is narrated by an intelligent AI that describes:
- Atmospheric scenes when you enter locations
- Your approach when talking to NPCs
- The mood and feeling of each moment
- Dynamic events as they unfold

### 👥 10 Unique NPCs
Each with distinct personalities, memories, and concerns:
- **Mara** (Tavern Keeper) - Warm but worried about thefts
- **Grok** (Blacksmith) - Gruff and direct
- **Elara** (Merchant) - Cunning with secrets
- **Aldric** (Guard) - Dutiful protector
- **And 6 more...**

### 💬 Natural Conversations
- NPCs respond based on their personality
- They remember what you say
- Relationships change over time
- Quests emerge naturally from dialogue

[THE CHRONICLER SPEAKS:]
As the night deepens, a warm golden glow spills from the windows 
of the Red Griffin Inn, casting an inviting radiance onto the 
dew-kissed cobblestones outside...

> talk mara

[THE CHRONICLER SPEAKS:]
As you approach Mara, her piercing green eyes, like lanterns in 
a moonless night, seem to draw you closer...

Mara: "Ah, welcome traveler! What brings you to the Red Griffin 
on this fine evening?"

You: I heard there have been troubles in the village

Mara: "Troubles, indeed. Someone has been stealing from my storage 
room. It started about a week ago..."

[Quest Detected: Investigate the Tavern Thefts]
```
