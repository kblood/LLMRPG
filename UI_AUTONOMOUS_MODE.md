# UI System - Autonomous Mode Action Display

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-22
**Status**: Complete - All actions now visible

## Overview

The UI has been enhanced to display all autonomous mode actions in real-time. Previously, the AI was performing actions silently. Now players can see:

- ✅ Action decisions (what AI chose to do)
- ✅ Action results (outcomes with narrative)
- ✅ Combat encounters (enemies encountered)
- ✅ Combat results (victory/defeat with rewards)
- ✅ Conversations (dialogue in real-time)

## UI Components Updated

### Preload Bridge (electron/preload.js)
Added 5 new event listeners:
- `onAutonomousActionDecision` - Decision making
- `onAutonomousActionResult` - Action outcomes
- `onAutonomousCombatEncounter` - Combat start
- `onAutonomousCombatResult` - Combat end

### App Handlers (ui/app.js)
Added 5 new event handlers that:
- Update status bar with action info

---

## Visual Indicators

The UI uses visual symbols to indicate event types:
- **⚔️** Combat events
- **💬** Conversations
- **📖** Narration
- **⚡** Quests
- **🎒** Inventory
- **💰** Gold/rewards
- **✓** Completed actions
- **○** Pending actions

---

## What Was Missing Before

Before this update:
- ❌ Actions happened silently
- ❌ No feedback when AI made decisions
- ❌ Combat starts/results not visible
- ❌ Players didn't know what AI was doing
- ❌ Rewards appeared without context

After this update:
- ✅ All decisions visible in real-time
- ✅ Action narratives shown as they happen
- ✅ Combat encounters clearly displayed
- ✅ Rewards and losses shown with context
- ✅ Complete transparency into AI behavior

---

## For Developers

The UI now properly implements the complete autonomous event loop:

1. **Backend** (GameBackend.js) emits events via `_sendToUI()`
2. **IPC Channel** (main.js) forwards events to renderer
3. **Preload Bridge** (preload.js) exposes event listeners
4. **App Handlers** (app.js) process and display events
5. **UI Updates** in real-time as events occur

This architecture allows for:
- Complete action visibility
- Real-time narrative feedback
- Dynamic UI updates
- Easy addition of new event types

---

## Continuous Event Log Design

**Key Feature**: The event log is **persistent and continuous** throughout autonomous gameplay.

- Events are **never cleared** between conversations
- Each new conversation adds a "💬 Starting conversation with {NPC}" event to the log
- All previous actions, combats, and decisions remain visible
- Players can scroll back to see the entire game history
- The log grows chronologically as the game progresses

**Event Order Example**:
```
🤔 Deciding: Investigate the tavern
💬 Starting conversation with Mara
[dialogue messages...]
─── Conversation ended (3 turns) ───
🤔 Deciding: Search the area
📖 You find evidence of recent activity
🤔 Deciding: Travel north
⚔️ Combat! Encountered Bandit Captain, Bandit
⚔️ After a fierce battle, you stand victorious!
💰 Combat victory! Gained 100 XP and 50 gold
💬 Starting conversation with Bandit Leader
[dialogue messages...]
─── Conversation ended (2 turns) ───
🤔 Deciding: Return to town
```

---

## Testing

To see the continuous event log in action:
1. Start the game with `npm start`
2. Click "Start Autonomous Mode"
3. Watch as the event log accumulates all actions chronologically
4. Observe conversations appearing as events in the continuous flow (not as separate panels)
5. Scroll through the event log to see the complete adventure history

The game is now fully transparent about what the AI is doing, with complete history visible!
